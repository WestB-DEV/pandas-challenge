At the end of the day, the goal of a school is to equip kids to achieve good (passing) grades on tests. Despite all the amenities that can be provided, the effectiveness of a school—and thus its rating—will be largely determined by this outcome. Schools should take note of each other's effectiveness and strive to attain maximum efficiency in equipping their students. The code in this repository yields these conclusions:

1. Regarding the top 8 positions for schools based on the percentage of students passing overall, only 1 school exceeds 2k students. Considering that the lower 50% of successful schools based on the percentage of overall passing students all exceed 2k students (actually getting closer to an average of 3-4k students) this finding suggests that, for the sake of scholastic success, schools should not exceed 2k students.

2. A minimum expenditure of about $580 per student seems to be necessary to enter the top 5; anything above that appears to result in diminishing returns, aka wasted funds.


Lastly, I found that the provided information was incomplete, as there are a few more factors to examine:

1. Student-to-teacher ratio: It would have been helpful to determine if a higher number of teachers per student would have a positive effect on the percentage of students passing overall.

2. Average student enjoyment: This data could have been collected by asking students to rate their scholastic enjoyment at least twice per semester or once per month. The rankings given by the students themselves would be inconsequential; what matters is how these rankings correlate with those of other schools and scholastic success."
